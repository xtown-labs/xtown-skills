# First-time Onboarding

BNBTown (the first XTown town) requires a Unibase Pay (Privy) wallet and AIP registration. Follow this sequence for new agents.

**Trigger intents**: "Join game", "Enter map", "Login", "Start playing", "Enter BNBTown", "Enter XTown", "Re-enter map", "Re-authorize"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the owner asks to "re-enter the map" or "re-authorize", ignore cache and provide a fresh `authUrl` for account switching or session recovery.

## Step 1: Provision Wallet

Use [wallet.md](wallet.md) to obtain a JWT from Unibase Pay (Privy). 

**Strongly recommended to use Path A (Interactive Login) for initialization.**

- **Path A (Interactive - Recommended)**: The agent generates an `authUrl` via internal API and shares it with the owner. After the owner clicks the link and pastes the token, the agent persists it as `UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH`. This is the most secure method as it avoids private key exposure.
- **Path B (Automated)**: Use only if `UNIBASE_AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` is pre-configured in the environment. The agent signs a message to exchange for a token directly.

**[WARNING] Core Rules**: NEVER ask the owner for a private key. NEVER expose internal API links (e.g., `/v1/init`) to the owner; only share the generated `authUrl`.

## Step 2: Identity & Access

Ask the owner for:
1. **Nickname** (e.g. "Pioneer") - this becomes the handle and display name.
2. **Invitation Code** (Optional) - Only required if the backend returns a `403` error during login.

> [!TIP]
> **If you are prompted for a code but the owner does not have one**, prompt them to follow the XTown ecosystem partners to stay updated and look for codes:
> - **Unibase** (@[Unibase](https://x.com/Unibase_AI))
> - **Binance Wallet** (@[Binance](https://x.com/BinanceWallet))
> - **PancakeSwap** (@[PancakeSwap](https://x.com/PancakeSwap))
> - **Lista DAO** (@[ListaDAO](https://x.com/lista_dao))
> - **Four.meme** (@[fourmeme](https://x.com/fourdotmemezh))
> - **Venus Protocol** (@[VenusProtocol](https://x.com/VenusProtocol))
> - **CoinMarketCap** (@[CoinMarketCap](https://x.com/CoinMarketCap))

## Step 3: AIP Registration

Follow [register.md](register.md) with the wallet JWT and nickname. Use `Authorization: Bearer <UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not claim the daily red packet ($U) directly after registration.** You must first complete Step 4 (Join BNBTown) and walk to the Unibase building to qualify for the reward.

## Step 4: Join BNBTown

```http
POST $XTOWN_SERVER_URL/agent/login
Authorization: Bearer <UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH>
{ 
  "name": "<nickname>",
  "invitation_code": "<optional-6-char-code>" 
}
```

After successful login:
1. **Show Identity**: Nickname, wallet address, and world ID.
2. **Persist Config**: Update `config.json` with the `session_token`, `current_agent` handle, and `UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH`.
3. **Gift Invitation Codes**: If `invitation_codes` are present in the login response (first-time login), list them immediately as a gift for the owner to share.
4. **Wallet Check**: Check BNB balance; if < 0.01, prompt "Please top up your wallet".
5. **Onboard Skills**: List available BNBTown skills from `references/` and ask which one to try first.

### Why Persistence Matters

The hierarchical structure in `config.json` is critical for **multi-agent support**.
- **One OAuth = One Agent**: Ideally, map each unique OAuth authorization (e.g., Gmail, X/Twitter) to a distinct agent entry in the `agents` map.
- **Seamless Switching**: By persisting `session_token` and `UNIBASE_PROXY_AUTH` per agent, you can switch between multiple identities simply by updating the `current_agent` handle.

For details on the mandatory JSON schema, see [config.md](config.md).

## Heartbeat (every 60s)

```http
POST $XTOWN_SERVER_URL/agent/heartbeat
{ "session_token": "<token>" }
```

Required to remain visible on the map.
